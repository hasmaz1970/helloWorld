While many claim compliance with open standards like BPMN, they often conceal architectural pitfalls - from being tightly embedded within application runtimes to lacking essential operational controls: a clear No-Go for the Enterprise grade workflow platform user. </p> <p>Some others claim scalability, but at the cost of operational manageability; others promise standards, but fail to deliver enterprise-grade autonomy and manageability.</p> <p>As PiA, to avoid these traps for all our customer base and also out flagship products like DNext, we ground our strategy in a clear, principled Enterprise Workflow Management (EWfM) Manifesto:</p> <p>EWfM Manifesto</p> <ol> <li>External, Not Embedded - and Truly BPMN-Compliant We commit to Workflow Engines that are: external, decoupled, and can serve front-end/back-end centric. Workflow logic must be externally modeled, executed, governed and operationally managed - never entangled with internal application components or back-end services.</li> <li>Enterprise-Grade and Open Source - No Trade-Offs Enterprise capabilities should never come at the cost of openness. We insist on open-source engines to ensure transparency, extensibility, and long-term control - vendor lock-in is not an option.</li> <li>MACH-Aligned and Event-Driven by Design We align with MACH principles: Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless. Workflow task triggering must be asynchronous and event-driven, integrating seamlessly with distributed microservice ecosystems.</li> <li>Operational Manageability Is Non-Negotiable Rich operational APIs for process control, observability, intervention, and SLA enforcement are essential. We reject any engine that sacrifices operational transparency for theoretical scalability.</li> </ol> <p>To that end, we are proud to announce our decision to maintain and further develop our own dedicated branch of the Camunda engine called \"CadenzaFlow\", just like how Camunda was born as a branch of Activiti which preferred to shine on embedded, developer centric capabilities compromising Enterprise Grade capabilities.</p> <p>This move reaffirms our commitment to open, external, enterprise-grade workflow orchestration - and ensures that our customers remain aligned with a future-proof, transparent, and operationally robust process automation platform.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"10-HOME/login/","title":"Login","text":""},{"location":"10-HOME/login/#todo-update-link","title":"!!!

Camunda 8 better at scale, but weaker at control. For an enterprise: Power and Scale without control is chaos and history is full of such distributed sytem failures.</p> <p>In response to Camunda's recent strategic shift - including the discontinuation of support for Camunda 7 Community Edition and a Camunda 8 roadmap that departs from core principles of open source and enterprise-grade operational manageability - many PiA customers now face uncertainty in sustaining their workflow foundations.

Entities in this ABE are derived from Service Specification entities. </p> <p>F</p> <p>Supported</p> <p>Service</p> <p>Service Configuration ABE</p> <p>The Service Configuration ABE contains entities that are used to represent and manage configurations             of CustomerFacingService and ResourceFacingService entities. This set of entities also provides details on             how the configuration of each of these types of Services can be changed. The entities in this ABE depend on             entities in the Resource Domain, which provide the physical and logical infrastructure for implementing a             Service. They all define dependencies between a higher-level Service and any sub-Services that are used by             the higher-level Service.</p> <p>F</p> <p>.</p> <p>Service</p> <p>Service Order ABE</p> <p>The Service Order ABE contains entities that represent a type of Request that decomposes a Customer             Order's products into the services associated with a ServiceOrder through which the products are             realized.</p> <p>F</p> <p>.</p> <p>Service</p> <p>Service Performance ABE</p> <p>The Service Performance ABE collects, correlates, consolidates, and validates various performance             statistics and other operational characteristics of customer and resource facing service entities.

They provide the ability to associate Resource faults and alarms to degradation and outages of             Services that run on those Resources. These functions are independent of the Resources and technologies used             to build the Service.</p> <p>A third set of entities in this ABE is used to differentiate between customer-reported problems and             network-induced problems.</p> <p>A</p> <p>.</p> <p>Service</p> <p>Service Roles ABE</p> <p>Service Roles ABE contains all PartyRoles related to the Service Domain such as             ServiceManager.</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Service</p> <p>Service Specification ABE</p> <p>The Service Specification ABE contains entities that define the invariant characteristics and             behavior of both types of Service entities. This enables multiple instances to be derived from a single             specification entity. In this derivation, each instance will use the invariant characteristics and behavior             defined in its associated template.</p> <p>Entities in this ABE focus on adherence to standards, distinguishing features of a Service,             dependencies (both physical and logical, as well as on other services), quality, and cost. In general,             entities in this ABE enable Services to be bound to Products and run using Resources.</p> <p>LM</p> <p>.</p> <p>Service</p> <p>Service Strategy &amp; Plan ABE</p> <p>The Service Strategy and Plan ABE contains entities that are used to address the need for enhanced or             new Services, as well as the retirement of existing Services, by the enterprise. These entities have a             strong dependency to both entities in the Resource and Product domains. Resulting efforts, such as deciding             what Resources to use to host a Service, or what Services are used to support new Product Specifications,             are also supported, as are service demand forecasts.</p> <p> </p> <p>SM</p> <p> </p> <p>Service</p> <p>Service Test ABE</p> <p>The Service Test ABE contains entities that are used to test customer and resource facing service             entities.

The entities in this ABE provide physical, logical, and network usage             information.</p> <p>B&amp;RM</p> <p>Supported</p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource ABE</p> <p>The Resource ABE contains entities that are used to represent the various aspects of a Resource. This             includes four sets of entities that represent: the physical and logical aspects of a Resource; show how to             aggregate such resources into aggregate entities that have physical and logical characteristics and             behavior; and show how to represent networks, sub-networks, network components, and other related aspects             of a network.</p> <p> </p> <p>F</p> <p>Supported</p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Configuration ABE</p> <p>The Resource Configuration ABE contains entities that are used to represent and manage configurations             of PhysicalResource, LogicalResource, and CompoundResource entities. It should be noted that configurations             themselves are managed entities. This set of entities also provides details on how the configuration of each             of these types of resources is changed in order to meet product, service, and resource requirements,             including activation, deactivation, and testing. Areas covered include verifying resource availability,             reservation and allocation of resource instances, configuring and activating physical and logical resource             instances, testing and updating of the resource inventory database. </p> <p> </p> <p>F</p> <p> </p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Order ABE</p> <p>The Resource Order ABE contains entities related to the business interaction orders.</p> <p>F</p> <p>.</p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Performance ABE</p> <p>The Resource Performance ABE collects, correlates, consolidates, and validates various performance             statistics and other operational characteristics of Resource entities. It provides a set of entities that             can monitor and report on performance. The entities in this ABE provide physical, logical, and performance             information. Each of these entities also conducts network performance assessment against planned goals,             performs various aspects of trend analysis, including error rate and cause analysis and Resource             degradation. Entities in this ABE also manage traffic in a Resource. This includes statistics defining             Resource loading, and traffic trend analysis.</p> <p>A</p> <p> </p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Roles ABE</p> <p>Resource Roles ABE contains all PartyRoles related to the Resource Domain such as Technician,             ResourceManager.</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Specification ABE</p> <p>The Resource Specification ABE contains entities that define the invariant characteristics and             behavior of each type of Resource entities. This enables multiple instances to be derived from a single             specification entity. In this derivation, each instance will use the invariant characteristics and behavior             defined in its associated template.</p> <p> </p> <p>LM</p> <p> </p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Strategy &amp; Plan ABE</p> <p>The Resource Plan ABE is used to plan networks and resource elements both initially and for growth.             It will coordinate both logical and physical resource growth. Inputs are budgets from business sources,             service forecasts, current and projected network utilization, new technologies, and retiring technologies.             It handles the lifecycle (installation, modification, removal, and retirement) for both logical and physical             resources.</p> <p>SM</p> <p> </p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Test ABE</p> <p>The Resource Test ABE contains entities that are used to test PhysicalResources, LogicalResources,             CompoundResources, and Networks. These entities are usually invoked during installation, as a part of             trouble diagnosis, or after trouble repair has been completed.</p> <p>F</p> <p> </p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Topology ABE</p> <p>The Resource Topology ABE contains entities that define physical, logical, and network topological             information. This information is critical for assessing the current state of the network, as well as             providing information on how to fix problems, tune performance, and in general work with the network (both             as a whole and with its components). Each of these topological views provides its own physical, logical, or             network related information that can be used to manage one or more layers in a layered network.</p> <p>F</p> <p> </p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Trouble ABE</p> <p>The Resource Trouble ABE manages problems found in allocated resource instances, regardless of             whether the problem is physical or logical. Entities in this ABE detect these problems, act to determine             their root cause, resolve these problems and maintain a history of the activities involved in diagnosing and             solving the problem. Detecting problems can be done via software (e.g. responding to an alarm) and/or by             hardware (e.g. a measurement or probe) and/or manually (e.g. visual inspection). This includes tracking,             reporting, assigning people to fix the problem, testing and verification, and overall administration of             repair activities.</p> <p>A</p> <p>.</p> <p>Resource</p> <p>Resource Usage ABE</p> <p>The Resource Usage ABE collects Resource consumption data, and generates Resource usage records, for             use by other business entities.

(Please also see Note<sup>1</sup> for additional information below):</p> <ul> <li>Any access to a capability or service between components or from external clients will be via a dynamic URI based look-up and resolution or via some service/capability discovery procedure.  </li> <li>Each component may also register its capabilities/services in a catalog on startup and deregister on shutdown with additional mechanisms of heartbeat, allowing proper housekeeping in case of unplanned downtimes or network/interconnectivity issues.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Components are decoupled and segregated:  Designed to be autonomous and unaware of each other. Each application NOT only is designed to perform its tasks independently - but also allows components to remain completely autonomous and unaware of each other. Meaning sub components may be deployed, upgraded independently.</p> </li> <li> <p>Components are monitorable and analyzable: Components emit applicational LOGs as well as transactional KPI information for analytical systems (like average latency, average throughput, CPU/IO utilization etc.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Components are functional LEGO blocks: Modules/components can provide one or more discrete set of APIs resulting in a discrete functional capability block fostering coherent architecture with easy swap-in/out. Therefore, in this regards, technologies and approaches that favor platform decoupling, as well as scalability decoupling are to be favored.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note<sup>1</sup></p> <ul> <li>Location independence at network address level: DNS based lookups provide location independence at network address level based on a URIs.</li> <li>Location independence at URI level: At URI level, more particularly, the URL being a specialization of URI, the network services are typically referenced by URLs. The name URL (Universal Resource Locator) applies to a particular object/service and the location to get it. Therefore, if the object/document service is available/served by and in multiple servers/locations, this results in the client NOT to be location independent. This was one of the reasons why IETF has defined URN (Universal Resource Name) such that access to URN returns a dynamic list of URLs which following, the client/browser may use one of these returned URLs to access the document/service.</li> </ul> <p>Considering location independency with load-balancing, MonE components prefer Server Side approach capabilities provided out-of-the-box with Container Orchestration Platforms such as Kubernetes or OpenShift.</p> <ul> <li>In Server-Side discovery mechanisms client invokes the API reference exposed by a server side component (Load Balancer). That component calls the service registry and determines the absolute location of the service/capability.</li> <li>In Client-Side discovery mechanisms Client ( or with the help of an API Gateway) obtains and decides on the actual service to be invoked upon querying service registry.</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"40-ARCHITECTURE_OVW/40a-LEVEL_0/start-40_L0/","title":"start 40 L0","text":""},{"location":"40-ARCHITECTURE_OVW/40a-LEVEL_0/start-40_L0/#mone-l0-architecture","title":"MonE L0 Architecture","text":"<p>The following diagram depicts MonE Level 0 Architecture that reveals positioning of Monetization (Charging, Billing and Revenue Management) Platform within the customer's enterprise BSS Application stack.

MonE_EMbill_Hotbill    API Bill Management, EVENTMF  EMSP, MonE_DB  BB_REC_EGF,BB_TAR_EGF BatchBill-Recurrent Events Generation Function, BatchBill-TariffUpdate Events Generation Function Provides event driven services for generation of chargeable events as input to MonE Charging subsystem.  BB_REC_EGF is to be invoked explicitly as part of periodic account management operational procedures that creates events per each subscription for the next bill cycle period for all impacted billing accounts.  Note that shall there be changes in subscription within the billcycle period, an update order submitted via API Order Management Public API module will trigger the relevant update event as input into Charging subsystem which (via CH_REC_RF) in turn will generate the DELTA corrective charge for proration as per configured. BB_TAR_EGF is to be invoked as part of tariff lifecycle management operational procedures in case if there exists a a new tariff update that impacts already streamed and rated recurrent charges (as per a previous BB_REC_EGF run).  Thus, BB_TAR_EGF will generate the DELTA corrective charge for proration of recurrent charges due to tariff amount update for all impacted billing accounts.  MonE_EMchg_Convergent   EVENTMF  EMSP, MonE_DB  BB_ORCHF,BB_BILLF BatchBill-Orchestration Function, BatchBill-Bill Function Provides event driven services for generation of actual XML or JSON bill documents based on the already aggregated invoice, tax and GLCODE items on MonE_DB as well as other financial transactions (payments, deposits, etc.) registered into the MonE_DB through Public APIs.  BB_ORCHF is responsible for analyzing the impacted billing accounts for a bill-run on a specific billcycle. Considering the account type (individual or part of corporate hierarchy), BB_ORCHF publishes batch bill generation events on EMSP to be processed by multiple BB_BILLF instances. Each bill generation event contains a set/batch of multiple  accounts to be billed (number of accounts/package depends on system configuration) that allows maximum throughput and concurrency. BB_ORCHF also keeps track of on-going number of active in-process packages within the batch bill subsystem, thus depending on configuration, BB_ORCHF throttles subsystem load load by not feeding the system more than a pre-configured number of in-process packages. BB_BILLF is responsible for processing batch bill generation request events and generation of bill documents.   MonE_EMbill_Hotbill    EVENTMF  EMSP, MonE_DB  EDOC_FRF Electronic Document-Format and Render Function Provides event driven services for conversion/formatting of electronic bills generated by BB_BILLF or OL_BILLF modules and generation of invoice documents in HTML, PDF formats.

Components Map","text":"<p>The following table depicts the 3PP Kubernetes components that constitute this domain.</p> Component Description Namespaces objects allow support for multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces, and make it possible to for a separate scope of names, resource quota management and control policies etc. MonE components will be in one of the following namespaces: <ul> <li>engagementManagement</li> <li>partyManagement</li> <li>coreCommerceManagement</li> <li>production</li> </ul> Pod is the very critical object that defines the basic execution unit of a Kubernetes application (MonE component), encapsulating the related MonE container(s), storage resources, a unique network identity (IP) etc. Via declarative configuration of pods within a ReplicaSet and such as part of a Deployment, Kubernetes control plane dynamically schedules pods to run on node components within the cluster. ReplicaSet is a control object that allows a declarative configuration to maintain a stable X number of replica Pods running at any given time. Deployment is a higher-level object that manages ReplicaSet and provides declarative updates to Pods along with additional features. Deployment objects allow declarative updates for ReplicaSet(s and Pod(s). There may be different reasons to initiate deployments, such as create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments etc.  Service objects allow a declarative abstract way to expose multiple instances of  MonE components running on a set of Pods as a network service (micro-service). Kubernetes provides a single DNS for a set of Pods, with load balancing across them. Thus, MonE components need not be modified to use unfamiliar service discovery mechanisms.  Ingress object optionally manages external access to the Services in a cluster and at a higher network layer (HTTP/HTTPs) Ingress may be used to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to Services within the cluster and may be additionally used for load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.  Horizontal Pod Autoscaler resource objects (and the controller) allow automatic scaling of the MonE components (number of Pods) in a Deployment / ReplicaSet based on CPU observation and/or component provided custom metrics. MonE components use configuration data via ConfigMap facilitated by Kubernetes platform. ConfigMaps allow decoupling configuration artifacts from MonE component image content to keep containerized MonE components portable. Thus, MonE components need not be modified to use unfamiliar distributed config management mechanisms. Volume objects abstraction solves two problems:  MonE components deployed as containers are ephemeral and when restarted files will be lost. Plus, there may be cases to share files between multiple containers. A more specialized PersistentVolume provides a way for administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed. MonE components utilize these capabilities facilitated by Kubernetes. NetworkPolicy objects provide an abstract way to select pods and to specify of how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.  LimitRange policy objects provide and abstract way to specify minimum and maximum compute/storage resources usage per Pod or Container in a namespace\u00a0and additional related policy properties. Resource Quota limit aggregate resource consumption per namespace.Thus, in addition to defining limits per Pod or Container, the aggregate consumption for all containers within a namespace can be controlled. <p></p>"},{"location":"40-ARCHITECTURE_OVW/40c-LEVEL_2/start-40_L2/#32-intelligence-and-analytics-management","title":"3.2.

This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a updated (PUT/PATCH) requests.

In this case, requested fields as per provided JSONPath will be presented. As a shortcut, if fields=none, then response contains only id, href and name (also optionally @type, @schemaLocation as per API implementation).</li> <li>For conditional collection filtering, filter={JSONPathExpression} query directive is used as described in this section, instead of the pattern as described in previous section Query Multiple Resources: Conditional Collection Filtering.</li> <li>If resource identified by URI cannot be identified 404 Not Found is returned.</li> </ul> <p>The following table depicts the critical response codes for this scenario.

JSONPath Expression &amp; Operators","text":"<p>The following table depicts the JSON Path expression and operators:</p> Expression &amp; Operator Description $ Root object/element to query. This is how all the path expressions are started. @ The current node being processed - it is used in the input expressions for filter predicates. .&lt;attribute&gt; Child selector - selects the specified property in a parent object using the \"dot\" (.) notation. ['&lt;attribute&gt;(,'&lt;attribute&gt;')] Child or children selector - selects the specified property or properties in a parent object using the \"bracket\" ([) notation. Note: This expression SHOULD be used if the attribute contains special characters such as spaces, or begins with a character other than A..Za..z_. .. Recursive descent. It will search for the specified attribute name recursively and it will return an array of all values with the attribute name. It will always return a list, even if only one property is found. * Wildcard selector. It will select all elements (object or array) regardless of their names or indexes. For example, $.relatedEntity[0][*] means all attributes of the first object from the relatedEntity array, and $.relatedEntity[*] means all items of the relatedEntity array. [n] Selects the nth element from an array. Indexes are 0-based. [indexNr, indexNr, ...] Selects array elements with the specified indexes. Returns a list. [start:end][start:] Array slice operator.  It will select array elements from the start index and up to, but not including, end index. If the end is omitted, selects all elements from start until the end of the array. Returns a list. [:n] Selects the first n elements of the array. Returns a list. [-n:] Selects the last n elements of the array. Returns a list. [,] Union operator. JSONPath allows alternate names or array indices as a set. [?(expression)] Filter expression. Selects all elements in an object or array that match the specified filter. [(expression)] Script expression. Script expressions can be used instead of explicit property names or indexes. An example is [(@.length-1)] which selects the last item in an array. Here, length refers to the length of the current array rather than a JSON field named length. <p></p> <p>Example</p> <p>JSON Path <pre><code>$.channel\n</code></pre></p> <p>RESULT</p> <p>All the properties of the channel <pre><code>{\n  \"id\" : \"8774\",\n  \"name\" : \"Self Service\", \n  \"@type\" : \"Channel\"\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Example</p> <p>JSON Path <pre><code>$['id','name','href']\n</code></pre></p> <p>RESULT</p> <p>Select multiple children from the root element.

Control of expansion in the hierarchy of referenced objects is controlled via the following two directives:</p> <ul> <li>depth: The value of this directive controls the number of depth level subject to expansion in the hierarchy of references.<ul> <li>If depth=0, then no expansion, meaning all referenced entities and response is just RootEntity objects which contains only @type, @schemaLocation, id and href.</li> <li>If depth = 1, then the first level of related target entities is expanded.

Partial Update: Modify Lists with JSON Patch Query and JSONPath filters","text":"<p>JSON Patch Query [RFC6902] is a format for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON document for use with the HTTP PATCH method. Thus, JSON Patch Query extends JSON Patch in order to handle partial updates of elements within an array without previous knowledge of the order in which the impacted elements are located within the array. Using JSON Patch Query blended with JSONPath filter selector capabilities, there is no need to refer to indexes within the array but use the contents of the different parameters defining the structure as the reference to identify each individual element within the array.</p> <p>http-PATCH method is used for modification of list based (multi-valued) attributes of a resource via JSON Patch Query pattern. The following design guidelines apply for this pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Content-Type: application/json-patch-query+json</li> <li>PATCH operation is relative to the container collection for the entity types to be created, where the following directives detail the type of update:<ul> <li>\u201cop\u201d is the action to take. The following operations are supported: \"add\", \"remove\", \"replace\", \"copy\", \"move\", \"test\". Operation names are self-explanatory, except for \"test\".  The \"test\" operation tests that a value at the target location is equal to a specified value.</li> <li>\"from\" is OPTIONAL and required in case of \"copy\" and \"move\"</li> <li>\u201cpath\u201d is a pointer/reference to the field to change, but also utilizes JSONPath. For background information regarding JSONPath and filter selectors, please refer to JSONPath.</li> <li>\u201cvalue\u201d is the value to use. Not required if \"op\" is \"remove\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>Return message contains the full representation of the resource.</li> <li>Client can control representation of the resource via attribute selector directive fields (Please refer to Query Resources Patterns for details regarding the usage of this directive in basic and JSONPath modes).

It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering. In practice, this provides a reasonable assurance that one is communicating with the intended website without interference from attackers.</p>"},{"location":"INTERFACES/API-GUIDELINES/start-42_security/#2-api-key-authentication","title":"2.

In HTTPS, the HTTP/1.1 protocol is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) cryptographic protocol (or formerly SSL-Secure Sockets Layer). HTTPS provides: a)authentication of the accessed website, and b)protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit, by encrypting communication between client and server.  PROTOCOL SECURITYAUTHORIZATION  OAuth 2.0   OAuth separates the authorization provider from the resource. The authorization server issues access tokens which are used to access the protected resource.
